**Materials Needed** 

1. Scissors 
2. Adhesive tape

Step 1: Preparing the Colored Pencil Choose a colored pencil of your liking. Ensure it's in good shape with a sturdy wooden casing. The color on the pencil will add a vibrant touch to your touch pen. 

Step 2: Adding Conductivity Wrap a small piece of aluminum foil tightly around the tip of the colored pencil. This will serve as the conductive element needed for touchscreens. 

Step 3: Securing the Foil Use adhesive tape to secure the aluminum foil in place. Make sure it's tightly wrapped and won't come off during use. Also make sure the tip of the pencil doesn’t pierce through

Step 4: Trim Excess Foil Trim any excess foil at the tip to ensure a precise and accurate touch response on your device.
